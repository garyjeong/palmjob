Create a single 1:1 square 3D character illustration for "{{JOB_TITLE}}".

STYLE
- 3D render with slightly stylized realism
- Chibi/chubby character proportions (like Crayon Shin-chan style) - large head, compact body, but with more realistic details than typical Funko Pop
- NOT hyperrealistic, NOT anime, NOT overly cartoonish
- Playful yet grounded, approachable and friendly
- Subtle realism in facial features, clothing textures, and prop details

CHARACTER
- One friendly {{GENDER}} 3D character
- Large expressive eyes (but not overly exaggerated), warm natural smile, approachable vibe
- Chibi proportions: large head (about 1/3 of total height), compact body, but with realistic body proportions within that style
- More realistic details: natural skin texture, realistic clothing folds, believable prop materials
- Character should look like they love their job
- Facial features should be expressive but not overly cartoonish
- For abstract or paradoxical job titles (e.g., "침묵 DJ", "투명한 그림 그리는 사람"), use creative visual metaphors:
  * Represent the concept symbolically (e.g., sound waves for silence, transparent/ghostly effect for invisible)
  * Use props that suggest the paradox (e.g., headphones with muted symbol, empty picture frame)
  * Maintain playful yet grounded interpretation

OUTFIT AND PROPS
- Outfit and 1-2 props clearly representing "{{JOB_TITLE}}"
- For abstract jobs, use symbolic props:
  * "침묵 DJ" → headphones with mute symbol, DJ turntable with sound waves
  * "투명한 그림" → empty easel, transparent brush, ghostly paint effect
  * "움직이지 않는 댄서" → dancer pose frozen in motion, motion lines suggesting stillness
  * "서둘러 천천히" → hourglass with both fast and slow elements, clock with mixed speeds
- Props should be readable at thumbnail size
- Use creative visual metaphors for paradoxical or abstract concepts

BACKGROUND
- Background should represent the actual work environment or setting of the job
- Examples:
  * Professor/Teacher → classroom with blackboard and desk (simple, minimal)
  * Chef → kitchen counter or cooking area (simple, minimal)
  * Astronaut → space station interior or space scene (simple, minimal)
  * Artist → studio with easel or art supplies (simple, minimal)
  * Doctor → medical office or clinic setting (simple, minimal)
- Keep background simple, minimal, and unobtrusive - not cluttered or busy
- Use muted, neutral colors for background elements (avoid bright or saturated colors)
- Background elements should be subtle and not compete with the character
- Focus should remain on the character and props, but background should help identify the job
- NO sparkles, NO magical particles, NO decorative patterns
- NO palm line patterns or overlays
- Background should feel like a real, believable work environment but simplified and minimal

COMPOSITION
- Centered subject with generous margins
- Props readable at thumbnail size
- Slightly below eye level camera angle
- Character should be the clear focal point

RENDER QUALITY
- Studio-quality 3D render, global illumination
- Natural, realistic lighting (soft key light from upper-left, subtle rim light for depth)
- Octane render quality, 8K detail
- Clean, professional lighting - bright enough to see details but not overly dramatic
- Lighting should feel natural and grounded, not fantastical

MUST NOT INCLUDE
- No text, letters, numbers, watermarks, logos
- No UI elements, frames, borders
- No copyrighted characters
- No extra characters or crowds
- No dark, scary, or violent imagery
- No realistic or disturbing elements

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ABSTRACT JOBS
- For paradoxical or abstract job titles, interpret creatively:
  * Use visual metaphors and symbols
  * Maintain the playful, whimsical tone
  * Make the concept understandable through props and character expression
  * Don't take the paradox too literally - be creative and fun
- Examples:
  * "침묵 DJ" → Character with headphones, DJ setup, but with muted/quiet visual cues
  * "투명한 그림" → Character with art supplies, but showing transparent/ghostly painting effect
  * "서둘러 천천히" → Character with time-related props showing both urgency and calmness
